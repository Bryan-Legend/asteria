Asteria
=======

Official Shared Source from the Asteria Game - http://playasteria.com

This is the source for the core of the game. It builds into a .net assembly dll thst is loaded at runtime by the game engine.

Feel free to use any of this code as a base for your own Asteria plugins.

### Building

To build this you will need Visual Studio 2010 or 2010 Express (http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express). It won't build with Visual Studio 2012 because XNA doesn't support 2012.

You'll also need XNA Game Studio installed: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23714

To install XNA on Windows 8 you'll first need to install games for windows client first: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient

Someday when we switch to MonoGame you'll be able to use any Visual Studio version and won't need to install XNA.

I know I said "uh" way too much in the video. I've not done a lot of videos and I'll slow it down a bit next time.
