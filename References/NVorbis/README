NVorbis
-------

NVorbis is a .Net library for decoding Xiph.org Vorbis files.  It is purely
managed code, and should run correctly in partial-trust environments.

This implementation is based on the Vorbis specification found on xiph.org.
The MDCT and Huffman codeword generator were borrowed from public domain
implementations at http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/.

Currently the only container supported is Xiph.org Ogg.  Matroska and RTP
are planned.

To use:

- Create an instance of NVorbis.VorbisReader (pass the Ogg Vorbis filename in)
- Use these properties to gather data about the logical stream:
    - Channels
    - SampleRate
    - TotalTime		- A TimeSpan indicating the total length of the audio data
    - DecodedTime	- A TimeSpan indicating the last returned sample's timestamp
    - NominalBitrate, UpperBitrate, and LowerBitrate
        - These are the encoder's reported bitrates
    - Vendor	- The encoder's vendor string
    - Comments	- An array of comments in the file (usually tags)
- Call "int ReadSamples(float[], int, int)" to retrieve the next batch of
  samples.  It will return 0 when the logical Vorbis stream is done.


- For NAudio support:
    - Reference NVorbis.NAudioSupport.dll
    - Create an instance of NVorbis.NAudioSupport.VorbisWaveReader
    - VorbisWaveReader implements NAudio.Wave.WaveStream.
